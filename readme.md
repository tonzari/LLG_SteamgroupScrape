## Problem

I maintain a Steam group that lists all "Language Learning Games" available on the platform. Each time I add a game to the Steam Group page, I want to be automatically update any other lists I may be keeping elsewhere (such as a website I am developing that will list all known "Language Learning Games" found across the web).

## Solution

For now, I've learned some basic python to export a text file with the list of games and their store links. Next, I want to output a JSON file so I can consume it elsewhere.
