###Problem

I maintain a Steam group that lists all "Language Learning Games" available on the platform. Each time I add a game to the Steam Group page, I want to be automatically update any other lists I may be keeping elsewhere (such as a website I am developing that will list all known "Language Learning Games" found across the web).

###Solution

For now, I thought I could learn a little beginner level Python to scrape my Steam Group page. Got that figured out quickly, so next I plan to somehow build a sequence of events that allow my personal sites to watch for changes on the Steam group, and update themselves accordingly. (Add a new game entry to the LanuageLearningGames website I am developing.)
